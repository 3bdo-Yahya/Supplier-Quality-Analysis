## 📌 Overview

This project presents a comprehensive **Supplier Quality Analysis** leveraging Power BI to explore the root causes and operational impact of defective materials within a supply chain. With over **55 million defective units** and **138,000 minutes of downtime**, this analysis uncovers critical insights into **vendor performance**, **plant bottlenecks**, and **financial loss** due to poor quality.

## 🔍 Key Business Questions

* What are the most frequent defect types, and which materials are most prone to failures?
* Which vendors contribute the most to defects and downtime?
* Are certain plants struggling more with defect rates or delays?
* What is the financial cost of these defects on operations?
